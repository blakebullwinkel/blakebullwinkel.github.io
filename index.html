		    <p>I'm a first-year grad student at Harvard pursuing a master's in Data Science at <a href="https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">IACS</a>. I believe in the magic of machine learning to tackle really hard problems, and I'm lucky enough to be doing that alongside <a href="https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/people/pavlos-protopapas" target="_blank">Pavlos Protopapas</a> and <a href="https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/people/david-sondak" target="_blank">David Sondak</a> through my thesis research on using GANs to solve partial differential equations. I'm also passionate about applying computational tools to challenges in environmental sustainability and devote much of my spare time to <a href="https://getmarble.app/" target="_blank">Marble</a>, a Harvard i-lab incubated startup bringing you carbon footprint estimates for your grocery purchases. (Coming soon!)</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2020, I earned my BA from Williams College, where I double majored in math and Chinese. I also spent my junior year studying at the University of Oxford, and before my undergraduate years lived in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sydney.
