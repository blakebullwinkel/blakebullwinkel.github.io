            <div class="bioContainer">
                <p>Hi there! I'm a first-year grad student at Harvard pursuing a master's in Data Science at SEAS. We live in a world with many problems, but I believe that data science provides us with tools to address some of the most intractable among them. In particular, I have a passion for work that lies at the intersection of machine learning and climate change. This year, I look forward to connecting with students and faculty who are interested in exploring this interface further.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2020, I earned my BA from Williams College, where I double majored in math and Chinese. In my junior year, my studies took me across the pond to the University of Oxford. Before my undergraduate years, I lived overseas and grew up in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sydney. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:jbullwinkel@fas.harvard.edu">email</a> me.</p>
