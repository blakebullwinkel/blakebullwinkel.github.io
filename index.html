                <p>Hi, I'm Blake. I recently completed a master's in Data Science at Harvard's <a href="https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">IACS</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/people/pavlos-protopapas" target="_blank">Pavlos Protopapas</a>. I believe in the magic of machine learning to tackle really hard problems. My <a href="static/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a> focused on using GANs to solve differential equations, but I've also done research in differential privacy and interpretability.</p>
                <p>I'm also passionate about applying computational tools to challenges in environmental sustainability and co-founded <a href="https://www.marblegroceries.com/" target="_blank">Marble</a>, an app that brings you carbon footprint estimates for your grocery purchases.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2020, I earned my BA from Williams College, where I double majored in math and Chinese. I spent my junior year studying at the University of Oxford, and before my undergraduate years lived in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sydney. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:jbullwinkel@fas.harvard.edu">email</a> me.</p>
