            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <div class="bioContainer">
		    <p>Hi there! I'm a first-year grad student at Harvard pursuing a master's in Data Science at SEAS. We live in an uncertain world and face many hard questions, but I believe that data science can help us find answers to some of the most intractable among them. Some of the questions I'm using data to answer this semester include, "<a>Who will win the election?</a>" "<a>What is the relationship between climate change, wildfires, and public health?</a>" and "<a>How should we allocate wildfire response resources to affected regions?</a>"</p>
                <p>When I'm not busy thinking about these questions, I devote my time to a project called <a href="https://getmarble.app/" target="_blank">Marble</a>, an eco-social app that provides users with environmental data in the form of carbon footprint estimates for their daily activities. I spent the summer designing and developing the app using React Native with a couple of friends. We can't say too much more just yet but are hoping to launch on the App Store and Google Play sometime in early 2021. Stay tuned!</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2020, I earned my BA from Williams College, where I double majored in math and Chinese. In my junior year, my studies took me across the pond to the University of Oxford. Before my undergraduate years, I lived overseas and grew up in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sydney. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:jbullwinkel@fas.harvard.edu">email</a> me.</p>
