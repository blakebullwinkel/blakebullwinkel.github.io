            <div class="bioContainer">
                <p>I'm a first-year grad student at Harvard pursuing a master's in Data Science at <a href="https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">IACS</a>. I'm broadly interested in machine learning and, specifically, in how learning methods can be applied to challenges in environmental sustainability. When I'm not busy with academic projects in this area, I work on <a href="https://getmarble.app/" target="_blank">Marble</a>, an eco-social app that provides users with environmental data in the form of carbon footprint estimates for their grocery purchases. Stay tuned!</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2020, I earned my BA from Williams College, where I double majored in math and Chinese. I also spent my junior year studying at the University of Oxford, and before my undergraduate years lived in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sydney. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:jbullwinkel@fas.harvard.edu">email</a> me.</p>

                <div class="projectElement">
                    <p>I trained tree-based classification models on historical wildfire and weather data to predict the fire risk for a given county and month in California and used mixed-integer programming to determine the optimal assignment of limited firefighters across the state based on total cost.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leveraged minority oversampling (SMOTE) on the training set to address imbalanced classes in the data and double the test set classification accuracy</li>
                        <li>Determined the optimal combination of random forest hyperparameters (number of estimators and minimum samples per leaf node) based on out-of-bag (OOB) error rate</li>
                        <li>Determined the optimal allocation of firefighters in each county and month by using a mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver to encode constraints on the number of available firefighters while minimizing total cost (based on cost of firefighters and fire damages)</li>
                        <li>Evaluated algorithmic bias by comparing the optimized assignment of department-affiliated firefighters to inmate firefighters and estimating the added cost of California's wildfire response this year due to the impact of COVID-19 on the number of inmate firefighters available</li>

                    <p>I built k-NN and regularized logistic regression models to predict the outcomes of the 2020 presidential and congressional elections using historical, polling, and "fundamentals" data.</p>

                        <li>Incorporated historical election data by deriving a "lagged fold-change" variable, defined as the % democratic / % republican votes in the previous election cycle </li>

                        <li>Built LASSO and ridge-regularized logistic regression models to predict the election outcomes for a given state and year from polling and fundamentals data (GDP, approval rating, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Evaluated model fairness by calculating false positive/negative rates and analyzed possible COVID-19 effects by using unemployment rates as a proxy</li>
